        <p>
          Mahjong is a tile-based game that was developed in China during the Qing dynasty
           and has spread throughout the world since the early 20th century. 
           It is commonly played by four players and is a game of skill, 
           strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is played with a set of 144 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols. 
          The goal is to build a winning hand by drawing and discarding tiles to form sets and runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game has many regional variations, 
          and the rules used in this app are based on Hong Kong Mahjong rules, 
          also known as Old Style Mahjong.
